# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
    - identifier_name
    - function_parameter_count
# opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
#   - empty_count # Find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`

# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:
# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this
#   - empty_parameters
#   - vertical_whitespace

included: # paths to include during linting. `--path` is ignored if present.
    - ../Workflow/Sources
  # - Workflow/Tests
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.
    - Workflow/.build/
    - Workflow/.swiftpm/
