#  About SwiftUIExample

## Overview
SwiftUIExample is a simple app with 3 main features: Mapping, QR Code scanning, and a Profile.

The project is designed to give you an idea of SwiftCurrent functionality while keeping UI code to a minimum.

## Areas of Interest
Here is a list of things that are interesting to look at from a SwiftCurrent perspective.

### ContentView
This starting view shows the creation of the 3 main `WorkflowView`s and how SwiftCurrent can be helpful in a `TabView` setting. 

### FeatureOnboardingViews
Each feature has an onboarding view. Look at these to see examples of single launch screens that can be placed at the start of a feature flow.

### AccountInformationView
This view launches a `WorkflowView` that contains a blocking view, `MFAView`, which is an example of SwiftCurrent usage for feature security.
