### If Applicable:
- [ ] Did you test when the first item is skipped?
- [ ] Did you test when the last item is skipped?
- [ ] Did you test when middle items are skipped?
- [ ] Did you test when incorrect data is passed forward?
- [ ] Did you test proceeding backwards?

### If Public API Has Changed:
- [ ] Did you deprecate (rather than remove) any old methods/variables/etc? [Our philosophy for deprecation](https://github.com/wwt/SwiftCurrent/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#deprecation).
- [ ] Have you done the best that you can to make sure that the compiler guides people to changing to the new API? (Example: the renamed attribute)
- [ ] If necessary, have you tested the upgrade path for at least N-1 versions? For example, if data persists between v1 and v2 then that upgrade should be tested and as easy as we can make it.
